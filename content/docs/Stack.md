# Stack

A layout primitive that can be used to create a vertical or horizontal stack of elements.

## Usage

```tsx
import { Stack } from '../components/ui/stack'

export const Example = () => (
  <Stack direction="row" gap="4">
    <div>Item 1</div>
    <div>Item 2</div>
    <div>Item 3</div>
  </Stack>
)
```

## Props

| Prop | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `direction` | `flex-direction` | `column` | The flex direction of the stack. |
| `gap` | `spacing` | `8px` | The gap between the elements in the stack. |
| `align` | `align-items` | - | The alignment of the elements in the stack. |
| `justify` | `justify-content` | - | The justification of the elements in the stack. |

## Responsiveness

The `Stack` component supports responsive values for all its props.

```tsx
<Stack direction={{ base: 'column', md: 'row' }} gap={{ base: '4', md: '8' }}>
  {/* Elements will be stacked vertically on mobile and horizontally on desktop */}
</Stack>
```
